# Real-time ChatGPT on ESP32-S3 with I2S IS43434 Microphone

This project demonstrates how to program a real-time ChatGPT on an ESP32-S3 using an I2S IS43434 microphone. It utilizes the ESP-ADF pipeline, adding custom audio streams for the microphone and voice activity detection, allowing the chat to run as a single pipeline. The project aims to create a low-power, cost-effective client for small items, leveraging existing ESP-IDF and new AI capabilities.
